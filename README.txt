# ChatUp - Just Say It Out

Chatup is an online anonymous chat forum developed especially for students, so that they can say whatever they want to say out loud and discuss issues they cannot publically. As oscar Wilde once said, "Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth."
You donot require any ID for login purpose. Just take up any random name, and say it out to the world.
